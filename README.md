# Wall-3 - the go-to page in the web3 world

Wall3 â€“ the go-to page in the web3 world.
Whenever a newcomer wants to learn about web3 they quickly realise that the world of web3 is chaotic and has a very steep learning curve. Here comes Wall-3, the first of its kind fully decentralized home page for the web3 world. Its mission is to drive web3 adoption, categorize and organize knowledge about the web3 world.
Wall-3 is a big dashboard of tiles which are decentalized, programmable blocks, created and rented out by web3 enthusiasts for web3 enthusiast and in the future governed by a DAO. 
So far in the prototype I implemented a couple of types of blocks:
-	A text block
-	An image block
-	A link block
-	And a more advanced NFT minter block
The blocks can form groups. The link blocks will lead to thematic subpages - read tree-like structure of web3 knowledge.
I created a block App marketplace as well.
IC is a perfect fit for Wall-3 because of its wallet-free experience, storage capacity and web app integration.
